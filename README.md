### Course Description

Machine vision is one of crucial robotics’ kit. Such that, Perception provides Robots with information about the world they inhabit by interpreting the sensor (Camera) response. It’s not an easy task to extract information from an image and take a decision based on it, it requires high level of image processing (machine vision). So, in this course we will start with low level of digital image processing. At end of this course, you will have a basic concept in field of image processing, how to deal with MATLAB’S image processing toolbox and you will be able to understand most of the building blocks in machine vision or digital image processing algorithms.
